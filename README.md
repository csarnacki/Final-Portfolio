# Final-Portfolio
My personal website that showcases some of the projects I have been working on. The projects created in this repository are composed of mainly JavaScript projects but I do have two project websites as well that I have built over the last two years. 

This is a much more updated portolfio than the first one I have and it does a much better job demonstrating what my capabilites as a junior level developer are. 

I invite you to take a look and leave me any feedback!
